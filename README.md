# [1.8 Combat]()     
## Minecraft: Java Edition - Data Pack  
### *Bring back 1.8 Combat!*    

#### `No attack cooldowns.`  Make combat the way it was in 1.8 and before!  
Gives the player an attack speed buff, `attribute @s minecraft:generic.attack_speed base set 25`  
(I have seen a few other renditions of this pack, but they all have some weird issue, this is such a simple pack, here you go.)  

`It just works...`  

Command:       
`/trigger tgl-1.8-combat` turn off 1.8 combat. (per player)   
Tips:   
`If your attack speed isnt instant, try the toggle command until it says "1.8 Combat On"`   
You will have instant attack by default when you first login.  If you die it will take 60 seconds for the attack speed to return.   
If you die and wait 1 minute before respawning you may not recieve the effect.  Use toggle command to fix.
