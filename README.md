# [1.8 Combat]()     
## Minecraft: Java Edition - Data Pack  
### *Bring back 1.8 Combat!*    

#### `No attack cooldowns.`  Make combat the way it was in 1.8 and before!  
Gives the player an attack speed buff, `attribute @s minecraft:generic.attack_speed base set 25`  
(I have seen a few other renditions of this pack, but they all have some weird issue, this is such a simple pack, here you go.)  

`It just works...`  

Command:  (coming soon)     
`/trigger tgl-1.8-combat` turn off 1.8 combat. (per player)
